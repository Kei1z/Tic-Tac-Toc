# Tic-Tac-Toc

A Tic-Tac-Toc made by C/C++. 

Having two mode: 
       1. Player vs Player 
       2. Player vs Computer
         For Player vs Computer mode, there are two kinds of mode, one is smarter computer and another is normal computer. I implement the smarter computer by adding logic e.g. Computer will block the place left if the player have two on a line already.
